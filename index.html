Actually there is one more thing.
mdbook.
It is not as powerful as hugo. It cannot even be considered as a full fledged package. It is just a wrapper around the mdbook crate. The biggest pro is tight integration with Rust. All documentation including about Rust, for example, the book, is generated by mdbook. Another good example is neovide website.

The general approach is to get the respective toolchain working, then find a hosting site.
I now ended up with two blogs. This very one that you are reading and another asciidoc.
My ultimate goal is to have a blog that supports
markdown asciidoc mermaid hosting in, say, netlify, github pages, gitlab pages, with automated CI/CD resize the image properly Hugo does have asciidoc support but why another blog?

The bad news is that the the official guide doesn&rsquo;t work. I am following the recipe from this post. It is not that difficult, but it needs to be set up each and everytime. May be I can custom a theme myself. This is the mermaid flowchart documentation.

This post answers the questions:
why i do it this way? how? I have been blogging since 2000&rsquo;s. My primary platform was google&rsquo;s blogger. It was a good platform. Yet it is geared towards blogging with a desktop computer. the 2000&rsquo;s saw the rise of smart phones or iPhones. I am an iPhone user since 3GS. I did have a period of time that carrying two smart phones with me.

The Hugo site and the ascii doctor site.
First step Install asciidoctor as described in here.
Second step Update config.toml as below:
[security.exec] allow = ["^asciidoctor$"] Third step Update github workflow with:
- name: Build run: | sudo apt-get install -y asciidoctor hugo --minify Essentially to install asciidoctor before generating the page

On the top is my M2 Macbook Air with which I am writing this blog. Below it is my M1 14-inch macbook Pro.
餃子 - the M2 Macbook - is my personal laptop. My previous Macbook Air was a Core2Duo 2010 model. It was still in good shape, solid build, the keyboard, screen display and wifi are all working good in excellent condition. The overall performance is the only reason to retire it.
