is that I have started his previous book <a href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ESI3PPG/>A World in
Disarray</a>. This one is more or
less focused on foreign affairs.</p><p>After I have completed the World, I was at an unease. I have finished
the book, but the carving for reading, for more, remains. I briefly read
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Bob-Woodward-ebook/dp/B098PDDZW3/>Peril</a>. But
quickly realized that it is more or less a vent of the Trump
administration. At the end of &ldquo;where to go for more&rdquo; section of the
book, I found &ldquo;immodestly&rdquo; A World in Disarray. So why not give it a go?</p><p>The tone, pace and style is familiar and so are some materials. It
served as warm up and continuation of the world. I am enjoying it and
learnt a lot from it. I have so far completed 25%.</p><p>More than once Richard has mentioned Henry. Henry must be some
heavyweight as he has been honorably mentioned a knowledgable man. Henry
is indeed an important man during the cold war. His book <a href=https://www.amazon.com/-/zh_TW/Henry-Kissinger-ebook/dp/B0046ECJBY/>on
China</a>
could be a must read about China. That is the next book in my reading
list.</p><p>My reading list should have ended here. But it does not. Thanks to J.
Bradford Delong&rsquo;s <a href=https://prosyn.org/RAIzwNl>The Strange Death of Conservative
America</a>. From here, I have learnt more books. The
first one is Geoffrey Kabaservice&rsquo;s <a href=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/rule-and-ruin-9780199768400>Rule and
Ruin</a>.
It is about the history of modern America. I haven&rsquo;t read it so I could
be wrong. The second one is Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt&rsquo;s <a href=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/562246/how-democracies-die-by-steven-levitsky-and-daniel-ziblatt/>How
Democracies
Die</a>.
Democracies have died? Interesting. That deserves a closer look. Last
but not least George Dangerfield&rsquo;s <a href=https://archive.org/details/strangedeathofli00dang>The strange death of Liberal
England</a>, where the
rubric of the article comes from.</p><p>OK, four books now. It should really stop - for now.</p></div></article></main><aside><div><div><h3>LATEST POSTS</h3></div><div><ul><li><a href=/blog/2025-02-11-emacs/>Emacs</a></li><li><a href=/blog/2024-10-28-my-adoc-test/>2024 10 28 My Adoc Test</a></li><li><a href=/blog/2024-07-15-write-something/>Write Something</a></li><li><a href=/blog/2022-09-23-one-more-thing/>One More Thing</a></li><li><a href=/blog/2022-09-22-so-far-so-good/>So Far So Good</a></li></ul></div></div></aside><footer><p>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://blog.freepackets.net/><b>william</b></a>.</p></footer></body></html>
