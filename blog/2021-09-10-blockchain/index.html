I have learnt about Decentraland and earth2. Those are new metaverses
based on blockchain - particular Ethereum. I will learn about Ethereum,
but now I need to sort out Rust and Python. These languages are of a
little priority now.</p><p>Rust is purely a personal hobby. It is the most liked language in
stack overflow, so must be something that can have a closer look. I have
grasped around 20% of it so far. The key concepts such as ownership and
traits, though I have got a vague picture of it, but not a very solid
understanding. I am working on rustlings now. After that, I will follow
the materials <a href=https://w62.github.io/post/2021/09/08/rust.html>listed in my previous
post</a>.</p><p>Python is about network automation. I am working in a Juniper house and
I think it is really time to modernize my knowledge and skill sets.
There are some technical and non-technical issues which is not an
appropriate topic for a GitHub page blog. Nevertheless, that won&rsquo;t stop
me from advancing my skill sets.</p><p>I have glanced though <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Network-Programmability-Automation-Next-Generation-Engineer/dp/1491931256>Network Programmability and
Automation</a>.
That fits my working environment mostly. Python is the central working
horse of the entire idea - just like BGP is the working horse in the
Juniper world. So I can&rsquo;t avoid Python. If I can&rsquo;t avoid it, take it.</p><p>With respect to Rust, Python is easy. There are tones of books about
data science, exel automation etc. The limitation is your imagination.
Whatever, get Python first.</p></div></article></main><aside><div><div><h3>LATEST POSTS</h3></div><div><ul><li><a href=/blog/2022-09-20-mermaid/>Mermaid in asciidoc</a></li><li><a href=/blog/2022-09-19-mermaid-at-last/>Mermaid at Last</a></li><li><a href=/blog/2022-09-18-ascii-template/>Ascii Template</a></li><li><a href=/blog/2022-09-17-test-asciidoc/>Test asciidoc</a></li><li><a href=/blog/2022-09-16-why-i-use-hugo/>Why I Use Hugo</a></li></ul></div></div></aside><footer><p>&copy; 2022 <a href=https://blog.freepackets.net/><b>William's site</b></a>.</p></footer></body></html>
