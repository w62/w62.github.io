I have learnt about Decentraland and earth2. Those are new metaverses
based on blockchain - particular Ethereum. I will learn about Ethereum,
but now I need to sort out Rust and Python. These languages are of a
little priority now.</p><p>Rust is purely a personal hobby. It is the most liked language in
stack overflow, so must be something that can have a closer look. I have
grasped around 20% of it so far. The key concepts such as ownership and
traits, though I have got a vague picture of it, but not a very solid
understanding. I am working on rustlings now. After that, I will follow
the materials <a href=https://w62.github.io/post/2021/09/08/rust.html>listed in my previous
post</a>.</p><p>Python is about network automation. I am working in a Juniper house and
I think it is really time to modernize my knowledge and skill sets.
There are some technical and non-technical issues which is not an
appropriate topic for a GitHub page blog. Nevertheless, that won&rsquo;t stop
me from advancing my skill sets.</p><p>I have glanced though <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Network-Programmability-Automation-Next-Generation-Engineer/dp/1491931256>Network Programmability and
Automation</a>.
That fits my working environment mostly. Python is the central working
horse of the entire idea - just like BGP is the working horse in the
Juniper world. So I can&rsquo;t avoid Python. If I can&rsquo;t avoid it, take it.</p><p>With respect to Rust, Python is easy. There are tones of books about
data science, exel automation etc. The limitation is your imagination.
Whatever, get Python first.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://blog.freepackets.net/>&copy; William's site 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
