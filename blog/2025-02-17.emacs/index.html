it, try to use it and even compile from the <a href=https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git>git repo</a>.</p><p>I recalled my memories about the emacs built-in tutorial to gain basic
keyboard nevigation and editing. Then read about the<a href=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/emacs.html> manual.</a> It is a
quite an undertaking. I just glanced through it and get most of my
basic editing tasks done. I am sure that I will come back to it on and
off.</p><p>Then <a href=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/eintr.html>An
Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp</a>. It is very basic
introduction to Emacs Lisp and functional programming in a general
sense. The reading experience is a small surprise. The author [[<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_J._Chassell][Robert>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_J._Chassell][Robert</a></p><ol><li>Chassell]] writes the book with a light-hearted humor as he is</li></ol><p>treating the reader as a friend and discuss emacs over the coffee
table. Unfortunately such a talent is lost in 2017.</p><p>After I get started with Lisp, I dig deeper with the <a href=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/elisp.html>Emacs Lisp
Reference Manual</a>. It is even a heavier undertaking. It covers
essentially each and every aspects about lisp. Again, I have glanced
through it. The takeaway is that I have a better understanding about
lambda functions and closures. I do not completely understand the
concepts in a crystal clear way but the looming picture is clearer.</p><p>Learning emacs is a bit complicated for me. I am somehow at a lost at
this point. I get started by treating emacs as an editor. Then
realised that it is in fact a lisp interpreter wrapped with various
editing functions. It can be learnt as using a collection of lisp
libraries. If you have used and developed <a href=https://winworldpc.com/product/dbase/iii-plus-v11>dBase III+, </a>you will see
what I mean. Each aspect demands knowledge of the other. The typical
example is that, after learning some of the major lisp functions,
everything makes sense in the editing keystrokes. But quickly
the entire emacs knowledge increases.</p><p>Now I tried to take a glimspe of the source code. It is C wrapped with a lots of lisp functions. Things might not progress too much at this front.</p><p>While I am foraying into the emacs echo system, I have come aross <a href=https://lambdaland.org/>Ashton Wiersdorf</a>'s webpage. He is a PhD student, a FreeBSD user and most importantly, an emacs user. His blog posts have shed some lights on my journey on emacs and it seems that we have similar mindsets.</p><p>Last but not least, this is the emacs I am using:
