Actually there is one more thing.
mdbook.
It is not as powerful as hugo. It cannot even be considered as a full fledged package. It is just a wrapper around the mdbook crate. The biggest pro is tight integration with Rust. All documentation including about Rust, for example, the book, is generated by mdbook. Another good example is neovide website.</description></item><item><title>So Far So Good</title><link>https://blog.freepackets.net/blog/2022-09-22-so-far-so-good/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2022 19:29:44 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog.freepackets.net/blog/2022-09-22-so-far-so-good/</guid><description>In the last a couple of days, I have been researching about writing in markdown and asciidoc. The general approach is to get the respective toolchain working, then find a hosting site.
I now ended up with two blogs. This very one that you are reading and another asciidoc.
My ultimate goal is to have a blog that supports
markdown asciidoc mermaid hosting in, say, netlify, github pages, gitlab pages, with automated CI/CD resize the image properly Hugo does have asciidoc support but why another blog?</description></item><item><title>Mermaid in asciidoc</title><link>https://blog.freepackets.net/blog/2022-09-20-mermaid/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 00:16:24 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog.freepackets.net/blog/2022-09-20-mermaid/</guid><description> graph TD; A-->B; A-->C; B-->D; C-->D; E-R Diagram erDiagram CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses</description></item><item><title>Mermaid at Last</title><link>https://blog.freepackets.net/blog/2022-09-19-mermaid-at-last/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2022 16:32:56 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog.freepackets.net/blog/2022-09-19-mermaid-at-last/</guid><description>At last I have got mermaid working!

It was a very smooth and simple process.
The main reason for migrating away from Jekyll is I am fed up with it. It needs to establish an entire Ruby environment in order to use it. Like you want to drive a car but you need to build a factory to manufacture the car you want to drive.
Another thing is, I can never figure out how to run the site locally.</description></item><item><title>some logos</title><link>https://blog.freepackets.net/blog/2022-08-16-12-12-03/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 12:12:03 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog.freepackets.net/blog/2022-08-16-12-12-03/</guid><description>Here are some logos about Linux and Rust.

The bad news is that I have started his previous book A World in Disarray. This one is more or less focused on foreign affairs.
After I have completed the World, I was at an unease. I have finished the book, but the carving for reading, for more, remains. I briefly read Peril. But quickly realized that it is more or less a vent of the Trump administration.</description></item><item><title>books I read</title><link>https://blog.freepackets.net/blog/2021-09-28-books-i-read/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 20:50:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog.freepackets.net/blog/2021-09-28-books-i-read/</guid><description>Recently I have tried to read more than one book. I divided them into two categories: technical and non-technical. Technical are those related to computer while non-technical are the rest. It could be fiction as well as non-fiction.
The technical books are related to hard skills such as Rust, TerminusDB etc. The contents are imperative and straight forward. There are many books on Rust, for example. The version of Rust might be a little bit different, but the language itself won&amp;rsquo;t change.</description></item><item><title>blockchain</title><link>https://blog.freepackets.net/blog/2021-09-10-blockchain/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 23:50:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog.freepackets.net/blog/2021-09-10-blockchain/</guid><description>From here, I have learnt about Decentraland and earth2. Those are new metaverses based on blockchain - particular Ethereum. I will learn about Ethereum, but now I need to sort out Rust and Python. These languages are of a little priority now.
Rust is purely a personal hobby. It is the most liked language in stack overflow, so must be something that can have a closer look. I have grasped around 20% of it so far.</description></item><item><title>Astr0 Baby</title><link>https://blog.freepackets.net/blog/2021-09-09-astr0-baby/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 09:50:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://blog.freepackets.net/blog/2021-09-09-astr0-baby/</guid><description>He is a guy quite into virtualisation of old systems.

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.
Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:
YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP
Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and MARKUP is the file extension representing the format used in the file.</description></item></channel></rss>
