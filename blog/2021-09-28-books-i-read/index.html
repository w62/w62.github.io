I divided them into
two categories: technical and non-technical. Technical are those related
to computer while non-technical are the rest. It could be fiction as
well as non-fiction.</p><p>The technical books are related to hard skills such as Rust, TerminusDB
etc. The contents are imperative and straight forward. There are many
books on Rust, for example. The version of Rust might be a little bit
different, but the language itself won&rsquo;t change. The approach of the
authors might or might not be appealing, but the presentation is another
story.</p><p>For the technical books, they are mostly related to Rust. The first one
is <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Rust-Fast-Systems-Development/dp/1492052590>Programming
Rust</a>.
It is the latest brick and mortar books that covers 1.5. Along with it,
I am of course reading <a href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/>the book</a>. I
did finish reading it, but just want something more extensive. That is
why I picked up Programming Rust.</p><p>Other than Rust, I causally glancing Python with the <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-2nd-Edition/dp/1593279280>Python crash
course</a>.
The main reason is that I found myself that I need to learn Python sooner or
later <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Network-Programmability-Automation-Next-Generation-Engineer/dp/1491931256>Network Programmability and
Automation</a>.
A little surprise is that MinEcraft can be programmed by Python. That is
interesting. <a href=https://nostarch.com/programwithminecraft>Learn to Program with Minecraft</a>
has the details about it.</p><p>For the non-technical books, I am reading <a href=https://www.amazon.com/World-Brief-Introduction-Richard-Haass/dp/0399562397>The World by Richard
Haass</a>.
It is an introduction to the modern history and politics of the world.
It also why things are happening the way they are now. It is those kinds
of books that I regard as the introduction to the field. In this case,
basic politics, economics and history. For my personal view about the
book, I have written a review <a href="https://www.amazon.com/review/RI8NRFJ4MTD5C/ref=pe_1098610_137716200_cm_rv_eml_rv0_rv">here</a>.</p><p>Another one is
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Dune-Frank-Herbert-ebook/dp/B00B7NPRY8>Dune</a>. I
have tried my best to finish the book before the movie adaption, but I
failed miserably. I have so far completed only 15% of it, according to
the statistics of my kindle.</p><p>So far I can read around two to three books simultaneously. The
&ldquo;context switching&rdquo; from Rust to Dune takes some energy. I am getting
used to it so that it is taking lesser and lesser.</p><p>Yet a <a href=https://www.amazon.com/-/zh_TW/Bob-Woodward-ebook/dp/B098PDDZW3/>third
book</a> is
looming in the dark. I am dragged into it even before I finished the
sample. What I will do is to finish the world asap so that I can start
reading it asap.</p><p>Reading, and writing, is fun.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://blog.freepackets.net/>&copy; William's site 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
