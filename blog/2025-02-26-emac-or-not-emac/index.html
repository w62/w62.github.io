However, today I have come across <a href=https://diego.codes/post/back-to-writing/>this post</a>. I have learnt the term <a href=https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DotEmacsBankruptcy>.emacs Bankruptcy</a>.</p><p>In his case, over the days, the configuration of his emacs is getting bigger and bigger that needs a reboot, or fall under its own weight. He also doubts that whether he needs the power of <a href=https://orgmode.org/>org-mode</a>.</p><p>He repeatedly emphasizes that he likes emacs. At some point during last week, I even seriously thought about getting a 10-inch <a href=https://www.chuwi.com/product/items/chuwi-minibook-x-n150.html>chuwi</a> just for emacs. My goals was to have a dedicated emacs &ldquo;appliance&rdquo; so that I can carry it anywhere. But nothing beats the wake-up speed, or snappiness, of a macbook. So I gave it up quickly.</p><p>But</p><blockquote><p>realized that I enjoyed customizing it more than I actually enjoyed using it in my day-to-day.</p></blockquote><p>I do share the same idea to a certain extent. I enjoyed fooling around my init.el file, learning some lisp programming, digging into the source tree of eamcs repo. Then suddenly, I recalled that I started with searching for a terminal based editor to write some blog posts.</p><p>For most terminal based text editor users, may it be <a href=https://neovim.io/>neovim</a> or <a href=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>emacs</a>, one of the main reasons is to <em>NOT</em> using the mouse. Well, I am not a very keen mouse user. I use trackpads.</p><p>In fact, in recent years, I have seldomly touched a decent keyboard. My <a href=https://www.hhkeyboard.com/uk/products/hybrid-type-s>hhkb type-S</a> is sitting quietly in my drawer. I enjoy the experiences of using a keyboard with a large trackpad beneath it. My 14-inch macbook air is a text book implementation of it. My X13 also offers a similar keyboard with trackpad usage experiences.</p><p>When I am moving my fingers over the trackpad for GUI related things, I don&rsquo;t feel distracted. In fact, as far as I am concerned, the trackpad is a good pointing device.</p><p>I have even seriously looking for a trackpad that works with my hhkb, but soon I gave up. There is a huge mechanical keyboard market, but there is no a trackpad market. That is why I stick to a laptop no matter where I am. I am writing this with my mac book air on my desk.</p><p>So here I am again, writing my blog post with VS Code in markdown. There is one thing that org-mode does not have - <a href=https://mermaid.js.org/>mermaid</a> which is very handy to present some basic diagrams.</p><p>I am not taking any realms or sizes and I am open. I don&rsquo;t mind using or trying any text editors or tools. I just use the right tools for the right task. Hugo has native org-mode support as well as markdown. org-mode is powerful that markdown. But for me, I just want to write and jot down something quick and easy. Markdown serves me well yet org-mode is an overkill. So I just go back to markdown. As simple as that.</p></div></article></main><aside><div><div><h3>LATEST POSTS</h3></div><div><ul><li><a href=/blog/2025-02-26-emac-or-not-emac/>2025 02 26 Emac or Not Emac</a></li><li><a href=/blog/2025-02-17.emacs/>emacs</a></li><li><a href=/blog/2025-02-11-emacs/>Emacs</a></li><li><a href=/blog/2024-10-28-my-adoc-test/>2024 10 28 My Adoc Test</a></li><li><a href=/blog/2024-07-15-write-something/>Write Something</a></li></ul></div></div></aside><footer><p>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://blog.freepackets.net/><b>william</b></a>.</p></footer></body></html>
