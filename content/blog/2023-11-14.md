There are different [C++ coding standards](https://www.perforce.com/blog/qac/misra-cpp-2023-intro).

[MISRA](https://misra.org.uk/) seems has a very big say in the C++ coding style. MISA stands for [Motor Industry Software Reliability Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_Industry_Software_Reliability_Association). It produces guidelines for writing software for cars. 

Another one is [High Integrity C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Integrity_C%2B%2B). It is developed by a private company called [Perforce Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforce).

I learned about these C++ guide lines when I watched [the video about the C++ Core guidelines by Rainer Grimm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UONLB7wBVSc). Other than the guideline, another thing I learned is that [pointer is broken by design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UONLB7wBVSc&t=704s).

This is one of the argument: Guns are made available to you (for whatever reasons). You should not shoot your feet or legs with it.

There are also some extensive discussions on ownership and borrowing. It seems that the guidelines seems to guide you on how to deal with ownership and borrowing properly while dealing with the limitation of the language. Now the Rust ownership and borrowing makes complete sense. 

Since[25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UONLB7wBVSc&t=1551s) windows become a cameo of the presentation until the end. I personally would recommend an Apple Silicon Mac with Parallel VM. The experience is very smooth.

I have not see extensive guidelines in other languages. C++ is trying to be one size fits all with some not so successful attempts. People needs to keep on using it as the code base is developed in it. Rust might be in the long run but can be a long shot, may be 10 to 15 years later. Before that happen, we may have C++26, C++29, C++31, C++34, C++37, C++40 and C++43. If it really happens, I could not imagine how complicated the compiler could be. 

I don't think C++ would die away, as COBOL has been dying for the last couple of decades. With that said, being living dead is a much unremitting ruthless suffering.
