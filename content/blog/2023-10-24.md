I have got a very brief idea about what a fold expression is. Basically from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhk8pF_SlTk) and [cpp referecences](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/fold).

I have not completely understand it. All I know so far is:

- it is related to templates
- it is deal with a list of parameters

I will go back to here and update a bit more later, just like a JRPG.
