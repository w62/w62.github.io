Embedding the enitre [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) into C++ program is easier than I think. I have basically followed the [demo code of RobertoChapa](https://github.com/RobertoChapa/C-SQLite_Demo).

I put everything under the subdirectory db. Then I created a subdirectory sqlite for SQLite. In sqlite, it contains the amalgamated zip file of the source code, the amalgamated source code `sqlite3.c`, the header file 	`sqlite3.h`. These are the two main files to interface with the entire SQLite.  
 
This is my directory tree:

```
db
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── README.md
├── demo.cpp
└── sqlite
    ├── shell.c
    ├── sqlite-amalgamation-3440000.zip
    ├── sqlite3.c
    ├── sqlite3.h
    └── sqlite3ext.h
```

The content of `CMakeLists.txt`:
    
```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.12)
set(include_directories sqlite)
set(MYPROGRAM_FILES sqlite/sqlite3.c)
 add_executable(db demo.cpp ${MYPROGRAM_FILES})
 add_executable(dbsh sqlite/shell.c ${MYPROGRAM_FILES})
 ```

I have added another target called `dbsh` for the shell interface. It can be a very handy utility for verifying the content of the demo database. It can be thought as `dbu` back in the Clipper Summer '87 days.

When I was reading [Professional C++ by Marc Gregoire](https://www.wiley.com/en-ie/Professional+C%2B%2B%2C+4th+Edition-p-9781119421221), I input the Employer database program at the end of chapter 1. It is just a program illustrating the characteristic of C++. It cannot store the results, that is, the employee database, on the hard disk. So I have to input from scratch each time I run the program. Adding a secondary solution is the next thing to do. I stopped there as it might be an advanced topic for me. But now it is easier than I think, luckily.

I have forayed into database nevertheless, how about go a bit further? Let's say can we embed a NoSQL database? After some research [here](https://dev.to/objectbox/embedded-databases-what-is-an-embedded-database-and-how-to-choose-one-27m8) and  [here](https://thedataquarry.com/posts/embedded-db-1/), it seems that it is possible. There are quite a lot to choose from. Initially I  will take a closer look at either [ObjectBox](https://objectbox.io/) or [RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org/). The main reason is that both of them are in open source C++ projects. So looking into the code will definitely help my C++ learning journey.  But before that, I need to have a solid grasp of some other basic C++ concepts. Templates and lambdas are two of them.
