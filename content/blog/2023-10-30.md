In [Jason Turner's C++ Weekly Ep 348](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpqwCDSfgz0), he listed out an extensive C++ topics. Understanding these topics makes equips you with expert level C++ knowledge. **BUT DOES NOT** make you in C++ (programming). The entire video is about building a lambda function, from simple to complex, and different versions.

Here is list of topics:

1. lambdas (C++11)
2. struct (C++98)
3. constexpr (C++11)
4. operator overloading (C++98)
5. call operator (C++98)
6. const member functions (C++98)
7. braced initialization (C++11)
8. `auto` return type deduction (C++14)
9. "compiler magic" at 3:33 he says "because inside our the call operator overload we cannot see the `*this` pointer of the lambda"
10. function parameters (C++98)
11. pass-by-value (C++98)
12. attributes on parameters (C++11) e.g. `[[maybe_unsed]]`
13. pass-by-reference (C++98)
14. pass-by-value vs pass-by-reference (C++98)
15. pre-increment vs post-increment
16. trailing return types (C++11)
17. class vs struct (C++98)
18. private vs public (C++98)
19. implicit conversions (C++98)
20. function pointers (C++98)
21. static member functions (C++98)
22. using aliases (C++11)
23. efficiency when chaining functions, 6:35 generic lambdas (C++14)
24. templates (C++98)
25. template argument type deduction (C++98)
26. aias templates (C++11)
27. template instantiations (C++98)
28. `noexcept` (C++11)
29. `noexcept` in the type system (C++17)
30. variadic templates (C++11)
31. variadic lambdas (C++14)
32. fold expressions (C++17)
33. function attributes (C++11)
34. concepts (C++20) 8:47 to constrain the lambdas
35. non-type template parameters (C++98)
36. integer sequences (C++11)
37. template parameter pattern matching (C++98)
38. explicit lambda templates (C++17)
39. tuples (C++11)
40. unpacking of tuples (C++11)
41. variadic `sizeof...()` operator (C++11)
42. direct-initialization of members (C++11)
43. `mutable` keyword (C++98)
44. non-`const` member functions (C++98)
45. reference members (C++98)
46. member copies (C++98) 
47. object layout (C++98)
48. member padding (C++98)
49. order of construction/destruction (C++98)
50. generalized lambda capture (C++14)
51. immediately invoked lambdas (C++11)
52. return value optimization (C++98)
53. guaranteed return value optimization (C++17)
54. initializer_list (C++11) 
55. recursive lambda (C++23)
56. deducing `this` (C++23)
57. recursive functions
58. trivially copyable types (C++98)
59. higher order functions
60. dangling references
61. undefined behavior 16:10 overloaded lambdas 
62. inheritance (C++98)
63. multiple inheritance (C++98)
64. function hiding (C++98)
65. variadic `using` declarations (C++17)
66. scoping / lookup rules (C++98)
67. class template argument deduction (C++17/C++20)
68. deduction guides (C++17)
69. algorithms (C++11)
70. ranges (C++20)
71. `<functional>` (C++11)
72. virtual member functions (C++98)
73. member function pointers (C++98)
74. special member functions (C++98/11)
75. member function call syntax (C++98)
76. type erasure (C++98)
77. dynamic vs automatic storage (C++98)
78. 
79. Missing 
80. 
81. writing your own concepts?
82. type traits? 
83. operator <=>?
84. protected?
85. virtual inheritance
86. compilation model
87. ODR violations
88. preprocessor
89. project structure and layout
90. the breadth of the standard library
91. variable templates
92. coroutines
93. modules

From the comments of an user @darkmagic543, there are additional topics:

1. exceptions, catch ellipse
2. structured binding
3. forward declaration
4. namespaces
5. rules of 5, default and nontrivial/virtual destructors
6. memory, pointers and smart pointers
7. iterators and writing your own iterator
8. multithreading
9. numeric
10. explicit/implicit conversions
11. castings, slicing
12. variant & visitor
13. abstract class (pure virtual), delete, final // default as well?
14. consteval
15. packages & libraries, cmake
16. signed/unsigned arithmetic, bitwise operations, bitset

That is quite a list of topics.Jason has concluded at the end of the video, "and hopefully you can use this as a starting point for getting that expert levels C++ knowledge that you've been looking for". This is what I am trying to achieve.

I know some of these topics, but it is my goal to know them all. I will use this as a check list of the progression of my C++ learning journey.
