Finally I could write something again. I am writing this in markdown, my editor is [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and my keyboard is [nuphy 75 old edition](https://nuphy.com/products/air75).

I have been using the [nuphy 75 old edition](https://nuphy.com/products/air75) for a while. Then I have facinated by 60 keyboard. I have tired the [nuphy 60 old edition](https://nuphy.com/products/air60). My only complain is that both the  `` ` `` and the `~` characters are supported by the escape key. It is a bit annoying when typing `~` for home directories. So I go for the 75 keyboard. 

Then I found the [hhkb](https://happyhackingkb.com/). The `` ` `` and the `~` characters are now seperated from the escape key. It is quite interesting, so I decided to give it a go.

It works great with emacs and neovim. But writing in markdown, or any other non-programming stuff with a modal editor is not my cup of tea. Then I learnt emacs [org mode](https://orgmode.org/). Many people are writing seriously in org mode. 

Writing in org mode with emacs, it is an overkill. I don't need those sophisticated hide/unhide feature, moving items around etc. Most default keystrokes are `<esc>`-this `<esc>`-that, double tap which impose a lot of overheads. When I switched back to neovim, I have forgotten some of the keystrokes which used to be muscle memories. 

I have been thinking about it for a while.

For non-programming, I enjoy markdown most. So I need:

- markdown syntax highlighting 
- preview 
- and most important, a linter
- spell checker

[vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) fulfills all my needs. I used to write with [ByWord](https://www.bywordapp.com/). But it cannot simultaneously display markdown text and preview. 

The writing experiences is not that bad so probably I will keep to this workflow for a while.
