I have been bitching about [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [antora](https://antora.org/) in my [last post](../2022-09-22-so-far-so-good/). Actually there is one more thing.

[mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).

It is not as powerful as hugo. It cannot even be considered as a full fledged package. It is just a [wrapper around the mdbook crate](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/for_developers/index.html?highlight=wrap#using-mdbook-as-a-library).  The biggest pro is tight integration with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). All documentation including about Rust, for example, [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), is generated by mdbook. Another good example is [neovide](https://neovide.dev/) website.

neovide ([github](https://github.com/neovide/neovide)) is an interesting project that enlightens me in may ways.

Firstly, it is GUI client of [neovim](https://neovim.io/), my favorite editor. So what exactly the fuck is a GUI for a text, well terminal, based editor? It has a built-in terminal, so have a wrapper is not impossible. So after some googling, it about its [UI protocol](https://neovim.io/doc/user/ui.html). There is another [blog post](https://tarruda.github.io/articles/neovim-smart-ui-protocol/) describing it. An editor has a protocol. That is cool and enticing. The first thing to do is browsing the neovide repo. The [main.rs](https://github.com/neovide/neovide/blob/main/src/main.rs) documents the framework of it. That is interesting. It could be a very good starting point for me to learn Rust. 

After browsing the repo for a while, I have noted that it is essentially a `cargo new hello-world --bin` project. But within it, there is a [website](https://github.com/neovide/neovide/tree/main/website) directory created by `mdbook init hello-world`. There is one [github actions](https://github.com/neovide/neovide/blob/main/.github/workflows/website.yml) that builds it.  This approach of organizing source code and documentation is exactly what I am looking for as I want to document my own Rust learning progressions. 

After a further look at the structure of the code, i decided to create a similar github page despite I have not yet completely understood the details of the code. The result is [crab](https://github.com/w62/crab) and its corresponding [website](https://crab.freepackets.net/). The main objective of this repo and the web site is to keep track of my rust learning progression. So please expect shit happens and/or stepped on. 

As of today 23-09-2022, the site is not very exiting. It is just up and running as yet another [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Well, let's see how it goes.
