At last I have got [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/) working! The bad news is that the [the official guide](https://gohugo.io/content-management/diagrams/#mermaid-diagrams) doesn't work. I am following the recipe from [this post](https://robb.sh/posts/how-to-use-mermaid-diagrams-in-hugo/). It is not that difficult, but it needs to be set up each and everytime. May be I can custom a theme myself. This is the [mermaid flowchart documentation](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/flowchart).
