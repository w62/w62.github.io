In the last two posts, I wrote extensively about emacs. However, today I have come across [this post](https://diego.codes/post/back-to-writing/). I have learnt the term [.emacs Bankruptcy](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DotEmacsBankruptcy). 

In his case, over the days, the configuration of his emacs is getting bigger and bigger that needs a reboot, or fall under its own weight. He also doubts that whether he needs the power of [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/).

He repeatedly emphasizes that he likes emacs. At some point during last week, I even seriously thought about getting a 10-inch [chuwi](https://www.chuwi.com/product/items/chuwi-minibook-x-n150.html) just for emacs. My goals was to have a dedicated emacs "appliance" so that I can carry it anywhere. But nothing beats the wake-up speed, or snappiness, of a macbook. So I gave it up quickly.

But

I do share the same idea to a certain extent. I enjoyed fooling around my init.el file, learning some lisp programming, digging into the source tree of eamcs repo. Then suddenly, I recalled that I started with searching for a terminal based editor to write some blog posts.

For most terminal based text editor users, may it be [neovim](https://neovim.io/) or [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), one of the main reasons is to *NOT* using the mouse. Well, I am not a very keen mouse user. I use trackpads.

In fact, in recent years, I have seldomly touched a decent keyboard. My [hhkb type-S](https://www.hhkeyboard.com/uk/products/hybrid-type-s) is sitting quietly in my drawer. I enjoy the experiences of using a keyboard with a large trackpad beneath it. My 14-inch macbook air is a text book implementation of it. My X13 also offers a similar keyboard with trackpad usage experiences.

When I am moving my fingers over the trackpad for GUI related things, I don't feel distracted. In fact, as far as I am concerned, the trackpad is a good pointing device. 

I have even seriously looking for a trackpad that works with my hhkb, but soon I gave up. There is a huge mechanical keyboard market, but there is no a trackpad market. That is why I stick to a laptop no matter where I am. I am writing this with my mac book air on my desk. 

So here I am again, writing my blog post with VS Code in markdown.  There is one thing that org-mode does not have - [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) which is very handy to present some basic diagrams.

I am not taking any realms or sizes and I am open. I don't mind using or trying any text editors or tools. I just use the right tools for the right task. Hugo has native org-mode support as well as markdown. org-mode is powerful that markdown. But for me, I just want to write and jot down something quick and easy. Markdown serves me well yet org-mode is an overkill. So I just go back to markdown. As simple as that.
