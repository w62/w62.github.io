It was a very smooth and simple process.
The main reason for migrating away from Jekyll is I am fed up with it. It needs to establish an entire Ruby environment in order to use it. Like you want to drive a car but you need to build a factory to manufacture the car you want to drive.
Another thing is, I can never figure out how to run the site locally.

But it seems that my new neovim setup needs further polishing. I will work on it.
Until next time.</div></article><article><h1><a href=https://blog.freepackets.net/blog/2021-10-05-my-reading-list/>my reading list</a></h1><b><time>2021-10-05 22:40:00</time></b><div>The good news is I have finished Richard Hass&rsquo;s The World. The bad news is that I have started his previous book A World in Disarray. This one is more or less focused on foreign affairs.
After I have completed the World, I was at an unease. I have finished the book, but the carving for reading, for more, remains. I briefly read Peril. But quickly realized that it is more or less a vent of the Trump administration.

I divided them into two categories: technical and non-technical. Technical are those related to computer while non-technical are the rest. It could be fiction as well as non-fiction.
The technical books are related to hard skills such as Rust, TerminusDB etc. The contents are imperative and straight forward. There are many books on Rust, for example. The version of Rust might be a little bit different, but the language itself won&rsquo;t change.

Those are new metaverses based on blockchain - particular Ethereum. I will learn about Ethereum, but now I need to sort out Rust and Python. These languages are of a little priority now.
Rust is purely a personal hobby. It is the most liked language in stack overflow, so must be something that can have a closer look. I have grasped around 20% of it so far.
