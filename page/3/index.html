The bad news
is that I have started his previous book <a href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ESI3PPG/>A World in
Disarray</a>. This one is more or
less focused on foreign affairs.</p><p>After I have completed the World, I was at an unease. I have finished
the book, but the carving for reading, for more, remains. I briefly read
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Bob-Woodward-ebook/dp/B098PDDZW3/>Peril</a>. But
quickly realized that it is more or less a vent of the Trump
administration. At the end of &ldquo;where to go for more&rdquo; section of the
book, I found &ldquo;immodestly&rdquo; A World in Disarray. So why not give it a go?</p><a href=https://blog.freepackets.net/blog/2021-10-05-my-reading-list/>Read more...</a></div></article><article><h1><a href=https://blog.freepackets.net/blog/2021-09-28-books-i-read/>books I read</a></h1><b><time>2021-09-28 20:50:00</time></b><div><p>Recently I have tried to read more than one book. I divided them into
two categories: technical and non-technical. Technical are those related
to computer while non-technical are the rest. It could be fiction as
well as non-fiction.</p><p>The technical books are related to hard skills such as Rust, TerminusDB
etc. The contents are imperative and straight forward. There are many
books on Rust, for example. The version of Rust might be a little bit
different, but the language itself won&rsquo;t change. The approach of the
authors might or might not be appealing, but the presentation is another
story.</p><a href=https://blog.freepackets.net/blog/2021-09-28-books-i-read/>Read more...</a></div></article><article><h1><a href=https://blog.freepackets.net/blog/2021-09-10-blockchain/>blockchain</a></h1><b><time>2021-09-10 23:50:00</time></b><div><p><a href=https://www.reuters.com/technology/south-koreas-gen-mz-leads-rush-into-metaverse-2021-09-08/>From here</a>,
I have learnt about Decentraland and earth2. Those are new metaverses
based on blockchain - particular Ethereum. I will learn about Ethereum,
but now I need to sort out Rust and Python. These languages are of a
little priority now.</p><p>Rust is purely a personal hobby. It is the most liked language in
stack overflow, so must be something that can have a closer look. I have
grasped around 20% of it so far. The key concepts such as ownership and
traits, though I have got a vague picture of it, but not a very solid
understanding. I am working on rustlings now. After that, I will follow
the materials <a href=https://w62.github.io/post/2021/09/08/rust.html>listed in my previous
post</a>.</p><a href=https://blog.freepackets.net/blog/2021-09-10-blockchain/>Read more...</a></div></article><article><h1><a href=https://blog.freepackets.net/blog/2021-09-09-astr0-baby/>Astr0 Baby</a></h1><b><time>2021-09-09 09:50:00</time></b><div><p>He is a guy quite into virtualisation of old systems.
